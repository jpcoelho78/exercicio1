<center><p style="font-family: Georgia; color: 	#00FFFF;font-size: 20px;">Welcome to The European Conference on Arts, Design & Education 
<br>(ECADE2022), which IAFOR is hosting in the historic city of Porto,
<br>Portugal, and in partnership with the University of Porto, the
<br>ID+/Research Institute for Design, Media and Culture, and the


<br><b>IAFOR Research Centre OSIPP, Osaka University, Japan.</b>


<br>Strategically nestled on a beautiful stretch of the Iberian peninsula,
<br>and with over 2,000 years of history, Porto enjoys spectacular
<br>architecture, from the ancient to the modern, and the entire historic
<br>centre of the city, with its spectacular waterfront, is listed as a
<br>World Heritage Site. It is a renowned centre for great cuisine, and
<br>its world famous Port wine. This cultural, architectural and
<br>gastronomic centre will be an excellent venue for our conference.</p></center>


<h1 style="color: #FF0000;">TASK<span>#01</span></h1>

<p>ECADE2022 will explore and share how art, design and education together can have an
<br>impact, make a societal difference, and contribute to the economy and how we think, live,
<br>work, and learn. As we emerge from the pandemic, and face climate emergency, this is a
<br>unique opportunity to review our values, and thus renew our sense of citizenship, and what
<br>constitutes the ‘common good’ both locally and globally.</p>


<h1 style="color: #FF0000;">TASK<span>#02</span></h1>

<p>Our conference will look at how design shapes and mediates ideas, how the visual arts
<br>challenge and question our perceptions, and 

<span>how education seeks ways to develop our
<br>shared understanding and our skills,</span> 

to listen, and to find different ways to speak and to act
<br>together.</p>
